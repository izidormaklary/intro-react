## Mission objectives

### 1st part the basics:

- **getting started with react**
    * setting up development environment
    * finding good sources
    * thinking in React's way


- **Components**
  * formatting
  * handling
    

- **JSX**
    * how to use it
    * variables
  
### 2nd State

- **using State hook**
  *  the UI must depend on the state
  * make checkbox checked/unchecked based on the State
    * at first update the state with the modifications
    * then render the checkbox accordingly
  
### 3rd Interactive State

- creating reference to the input field -> using it in the function linked to the Add button
- lifting up State, so both the form and a list has (read/write)access to the same array

### 4th Side effects

- saving changes of the todo list to the local storage -> which is a side effect to react
- so a specific hook: useEffect is needed to handle it
